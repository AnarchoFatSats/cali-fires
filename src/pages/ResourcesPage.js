                  <ul>
                    <li>Take extensive photos and videos of all damaged areas</li>

                <h3>Understanding Your Policy</h3>
                <p>Most homeowner policies include these key coverages:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dwelling Coverage:</strong> Pays to repair/rebuild your home's structure</li>

                  <li><strong>Additional Living Expenses (ALE):</strong> Pays for temporary housing and living costs</li>
                  <li><strong>Other Structures Coverage:</strong> Covers detached garages, sheds, fences</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Common Insurance Challenges</h3>
                <p>Be aware of these frequent issues with wildfire claims:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Underinsurance:</strong> Many homes are insured for less than their replacement cost</li>
                  <li><strong>Inventory Requirements:</strong> Insurers often require detailed lists of lost items</li>
                  <li><strong>ALE Limitations:</strong> Coverage for temporary housing may be capped</li>
                  <li><strong>Depreciation Deductions:</strong> Insurers may reduce payouts based on item age</li>
                  <li><strong>Claim Deadlines:</strong> Missing deadlines can result in claim denial</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Tips for Successful Claims</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Document all communication with your insurer in writing</li>
                  <li>Create detailed inventory lists with photos, receipts, and estimated values</li>
                  <li>Get independent estimates for repairs/rebuilding</li>
                  <li>Don't rush to accept the first settlement offer</li>
                  <li>Consider hiring a public adjuster for complex claims</li>
                  <li>Be aware of deadlines for supplemental claims</li>
                </ol>

                  <h4>Important Warning</h4>
                  <p>Insurance companies often pressure victims to settle quickly. Don't sign releases or accept settlements until you fully understand the extent of your damages and coverage. Once you accept a settlement, you may be unable to claim additional damages later.</p>

                  <h3>How long do I have to file a wildfire claim?</h3>
                  <div className="faq-answer">
                    <p>Time limits (statutes of limitations) vary depending on the type of claim:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Insurance claims:</strong> Most policies require notification "as soon as possible" and have specific deadlines for submitting proof of loss (typically 60-180 days)</li>
                      <li><strong>Utility company claims:</strong> Generally 2-3 years from the date of the fire</li>
                      <li><strong>Government entity claims:</strong> As short as 6 months from the date of loss</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Because these deadlines can be complex and vary by situation, we strongly recommend consulting with an attorney as soon as possible after a wildfire loss.</p>

                  <h3>What if my insurance doesn't cover all my losses?</h3>
                  <div className="faq-answer">
                    <p>If your insurance is insufficient to cover your losses, you may have additional options:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Claims against utility companies if they caused or contributed to the fire</li>
                      <li>FEMA assistance programs for uninsured losses</li>
                      <li>SBA disaster loans for homeowners and businesses</li>
                      <li>State disaster relief programs</li>
                      <li>Tax deductions for casualty losses</li>
